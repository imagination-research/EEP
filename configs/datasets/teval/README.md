# T-Eval

Tool utilization is comprehensively decomposed into multiple sub-processes, including instruction following, planning, reasoning, retrieval, understanding, and review. Based on that, T-Eval is introduced to evaluate the tool-utilization capability step by step. T-Eval disentangles the tool utilization evaluation into several sub-domains along model capabilities, facilitating the inner understanding of both holistic and isolated competency of LLMs.
