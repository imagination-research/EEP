So the answer is 14.8.\n\nText: Playing in their second straight Thanksgiving game, the Eagles struggled especially on defense, where they were unable to stop the much-hyped Lions offense. The worst of it all was how unproven rookie Eric Rowe was tasked with covering wide receiver Calvin Johnson, leading to Johnson catching 3 touchdowns. Staffordâ€™s five passing touchdowns, including three of them to Johnson was too much for the Eagles to overcome and for the second consecutive time this season, the Eagles gave up 45 points in a game. With the loss, the Eagles drop to 4-7 on the season and 6-1 when playing on Thanksgiving.\nQuestion: How many TD passes did Stafford throw other than to Johnson?\nAnswer: According to the text, Stafford threw 5 TD passes, 3 of which were to Johnson. 5-3=2. So the answer is 2.\n\nText: {prompt}\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:',
